= Incident Response Report

== Executive Summary

=== Overview of the Incident

The analysis of the flagged logs revealed potential security incidents involving unauthorized registry modifications and suspicious logon activities. The events are indicative of possible defense evasion and system discovery tactics, suggesting a coordinated attempt to access and manipulate system resources.

=== Impact Assessment

The incidents could potentially impact system integrity and confidentiality. The unauthorized registry modifications might lead to system instability or unauthorized access. The suspicious logon activities suggest potential unauthorized access attempts.

=== Actions Taken

Immediate containment measures were implemented to isolate affected systems. A detailed analysis was conducted to identify the root cause and extent of the incidents. Communication with stakeholders was established to ensure awareness and coordination.

=== Current Status

The situation is under control with ongoing monitoring to prevent further incidents. Systems have been restored to their normal operational state, and additional security measures are being implemented.

== Introduction

=== Purpose of the Report

This report aims to provide a comprehensive analysis of the security incidents identified from the flagged logs, detailing the response actions and recommendations for future prevention.

=== Scope

The report covers the analysis of logs from various sources, identification of incidents, response actions, and recommendations for enhancing security measures.

=== Audience

This report is intended for technical and non-technical stakeholders, including IT security teams, management, and compliance officers.

== Incident Description

=== Timeline of Events

* **Event 1**: Unauthorized registry modification detected (Log Ref: 1).
* **Event 2**: Suspicious logon activity with elevated logon type (Log Ref: 2, 3).
* **Event 3**: Usage of PowerShell for potential system discovery (Log Ref: 4, 5).

=== Detection Method

The incidents were detected through automated log analysis and correlation of events indicating abnormal activities.

=== Affected Systems and Data

Systems with registry access and user logon functionalities were primarily affected. No specific data loss has been reported as of now.

=== Type of Incident

The incidents are categorized as unauthorized access attempts and potential defense evasion tactics.

== Detection and Analysis

=== Logs Collected

* System logs indicating registry modifications.
* Security logs showing suspicious logon activities.
* Sysmon logs capturing PowerShell usage and command execution.

=== Analysis Procedures

* Detailed log analysis to identify patterns of unauthorized activities.
* Correlation of events across different logs to establish a timeline and scope.

=== Findings

* Unauthorized registry modifications were confirmed (Log Ref: 1).
* Multiple suspicious logon attempts with elevated logon types (Log Ref: 2, 3).
* PowerShell usage for potential system discovery and command execution (Log Ref: 4, 5).

=== Correlation of Events

The sequence of events suggests a coordinated attempt to access and manipulate system resources, potentially for unauthorized access or data exfiltration.

== Response Actions

=== Containment Measures

* Isolated affected systems to prevent further unauthorized access.
* Implemented additional firewall rules to restrict suspicious activities.

=== Eradication Steps

* Removed unauthorized registry modifications.
* Terminated suspicious sessions and invalidated compromised credentials.

=== Recovery Process

* Restored systems from clean backups.
* Conducted thorough system scans to ensure no residual threats remain.

=== Communication

* Informed all relevant stakeholders of the incident and actions taken.
* Coordinated with IT teams to implement preventive measures.

== Root Cause Analysis

=== Underlying Cause

The incidents appear to be caused by unauthorized attempts to exploit system vulnerabilities and gain access through elevated logon activities.

=== Contributing Factors

* Inadequate monitoring of registry changes.
* Insufficient restrictions on PowerShell usage.

== Impact Assessment

=== Business Impact

Potential disruption to normal operations and risk of data exposure.

=== Data Loss or Exposure

No confirmed data loss, but potential exposure due to unauthorized access attempts.

=== Regulatory Compliance Implications

Possible non-compliance with data protection regulations if unauthorized access had succeeded.

== Lessons Learned

=== What Worked Well

* Quick detection and isolation of affected systems.
* Effective communication and coordination among teams.

=== Areas for Improvement

* Enhance monitoring of registry changes and logon activities.
* Implement stricter controls on PowerShell usage.

=== Response Effectiveness

The response was effective in containing and mitigating the incidents, but improvements are needed in preventative measures.

== Recommendations

=== Preventive Measures

* Implement real-time monitoring of registry changes and logon activities.
* Enhance firewall rules and access controls.

=== Security Enhancements

* Deploy advanced threat detection tools.
* Regularly update and patch systems to close vulnerabilities.

=== Training Needs

* Conduct regular security awareness training for staff.
* Train IT teams on advanced threat detection and response techniques.

== Conclusion

=== Summary of Incident and Response

The incidents involved unauthorized registry modifications and suspicious logon activities, which were effectively contained and mitigated. Systems have been restored, and additional security measures are being implemented.

=== Next Steps

* Continue monitoring for any residual threats.
* Implement the recommended preventive measures.
* Review and update incident response plans.
