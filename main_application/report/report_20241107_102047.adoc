== Incident Description

=== Timeline of Events
* Initial detection of registry modification [Log 1]
* Unauthorized logon attempts detected [Log 2, Log 3]
* System scan and containment initiated

=== Detection Method
The incidents were detected through automated monitoring systems that flagged unusual registry modifications and logon activities.

=== Affected Systems and Data
* Windows-based systems with potential exposure of system configurations.
* User credentials may have been targeted.

=== Type of Incident
Unauthorized access and potential system manipulation.

== Detection and Analysis

=== Logs Collected
* Log 1: Registry modification detected
* Log 2: Unauthorized logon attempt (EventID 4624)
* Log 3: Additional unauthorized logon attempt (EventID 4624)

=== Analysis Procedures
* Correlation of logs to identify patterns of unauthorized access.
* Examination of registry changes for unauthorized modifications.

=== Findings
* Registry modifications indicating potential system manipulation [Log 1].
* Unauthorized logon attempts using valid accounts [Log 2, Log 3].

=== Correlation of Events
The events indicate a coordinated attempt to gain persistent access by modifying system configurations and using valid accounts for unauthorized logon.

== Response Actions

=== Containment Measures
* Immediate lockdown of affected systems to prevent further unauthorized access.
* Isolation of systems from the network for detailed analysis.

=== Eradication Steps
* Removal of any identified malicious artifacts.
* Resetting user credentials to prevent unauthorized access.

=== Recovery Process
* Restoration of system configurations from secure backups.
* Reconnection of systems to the network after thorough verification.

=== Communication
* Notification to affected users and stakeholders.
* Regular updates provided to management and IT security teams.

== Root Cause Analysis

=== Underlying Cause
The incident was likely caused by exploitation of known vulnerabilities in system configurations.

=== Contributing Factors
* Lack of timely updates and security patches.
* Insufficient monitoring and detection mechanisms for unauthorized access.

== Impact Assessment

=== Business Impact
Potential disruption to business operations due to system lockdown and recovery processes.

=== Data Loss or Exposure
No confirmed data loss, but potential exposure of system configurations and user credentials.

=== Regulatory Compliance Implications
No immediate compliance issues identified, but potential risk if sensitive data was exposed.

== Lessons Learned

=== What Worked Well
* Quick detection and response to unauthorized access attempts.
* Effective communication with stakeholders during the incident.

=== Areas for Improvement
